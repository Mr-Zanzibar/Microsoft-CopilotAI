### Is this script safe? üõ°Ô∏è

Its only function is to modify the Windows registry in order to enable Copilot, so it is safe to use.

### This broke my PC!

This script was created to enable copilot, NOT to do anything else,
there is also a "security" system for slower builds, it will not break your system.
